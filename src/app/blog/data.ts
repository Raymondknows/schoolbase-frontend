          'A successful rollout does not have to begin with every module at once. Choose one high-friction workflow, such as student records and attendance, term invoices and payment recording, or assessment through result publication. Agree who owns each step, prepare the required records, and train the people who will use it.',
          'Before the change, note a few practical baselines: how long the task takes, how many corrections or follow-ups it requires, and how easily the school can answer common questions. Review the same measures after the team has used the workflow. Then decide what to improve and which connected process should come next.',
          'That is how SchoolBase becomes more than software your school has purchased. It becomes a system your people understand and use to run school operations with greater clarity.',
